## Gameplay Mechanics

- The objective is to guide your snake to consume food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with walls, yourself, or other snakes.
- The speed of the game varies based on the selected difficulty level:
  - **Easy Mode**: Slower snake speed for casual gameplay.
  - **Hard Mode**: Faster snake speed for an added challenge.
- The game supports both **four-key steering** (default) and **two-key steering** (enabled via `--two_key_steering`), which requires you to navigate using only left and right turns.

## Known Issues and Limitations
